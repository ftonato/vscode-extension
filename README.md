# Xata VSCode extension

Manage your [Xata](https://xata.io) databases without leaving VS Code!

## Gettings started

Once the extension is installed it from the [VS Code Marketplace](), it should show up in your Activity Bar like in the image below.

Clicking on any of the **Get Started** buttons should open your default browser. From there, login to your Xata account, and it will prompt you to create an [API key](https://docs.xata.io/concepts/api-keys). 

Once the key is created, there will be a new prompt to return to VS Code and your **Explorer** pane should be populated with your workspaces.
