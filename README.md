# [Xata](https://xata.io) [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Extension

This extension enables users to work with [Xata](https://xata.io) without leaving Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

Once the extension is installed it from the [VS Code Marketplace](), it should show up in your Activity Bar like in the image below.

Clicking on any of the **Get Started** buttons should open your default browser. From there, login to your Xata account, and it will prompt you to create an [API key](https://docs.xata.io/concepts/api-keys).

Once the key is created, there will be a new prompt to return to VS Code and your **Explorer** pane should be populated with your workspaces.

The second panel (`(uninitialized)` in the screenshot)) is related to your current VS Code project. After being initialized, this will add a `.env` with an API key and a `.xatarc` with your database access details.

While we recommend to version control the `.xatarc`, you should always add `.env` in `.gitignore` to avoid leaking the `XATA_API_TOKEN` and potentially other secrets.

If a `.xatarc` is already set, you will just need to login.

## Features

Here are some ways you can interact with Xata from our VS Code extension.

### Manage Your Databases

Create workspaces, databases, branches and columns directly from the sidebar.

### Preview & Insert Records

Preview, then insert your records into a database of your choice on Xata with auto-completion and validation.

After successfully inserting the record, you can save the file into your project for easy insertion in the future, or for sharing it with others: if they change the `"$schema"` parameter, the same record can be inserted into another database.

### Create branches
